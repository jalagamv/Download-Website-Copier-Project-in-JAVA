DESCRIPTION:
============

MiniCopier intends to improve graphic copy/paste file operations on some popular OSes.
Its features are closed to the ones of SuperCopier (Windows environment). 
It lets you create a queue of transfers, so only a file is copied at a time.
You can manage the queue by changing the position of any pending transfer.
It also handles pause and resume operations. 
If a transfer fails, the bytes already copied are not erased, so MiniCopier
can resume the transfer for you later. 
All the operations are done by "drag-and-drops" on the icons. 
MiniCopier is published under the GNU GPL. 


REQUIREMENTS :
==============
Unix system with: GNOME/KDE/XFCE
or Windows or Mac OS X
Java virtual machine 1.5 (or more recent)


INSTALLATION:
=============
Nothing to install.
(Except Sun JRE 5.0 or more recent)


RUN:
====
Just launch the MiniCopier.sh script.

/!\ If you have Beryl/Compiz enabled, you might get a blank windows. 
For a fix, you can try to add the line below in MiniCopier.sh

export AWT_TOOLKIT="MToolkit"

just before the line: java -jar MiniCopier.jar $* 

Options:

See configuration.ini (generated the fist time you launch MiniCopier) for
more options. 


USE:
====

Drag and drop files or folder you wish to copy on the basket icon.
Once you're done with filling the basket, drag and drop a destination folder
to the box icon. All the content of the basket will be copied to that directory.
